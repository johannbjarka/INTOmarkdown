We both used Virtualbox and Ubuntu version 13.04 to install Linux. The process was quick and painless.

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

We both mostly had no problems installing vim and git except Andri experienced some difficulty getting the wifi network to work with Linux. A quick restart fixed the problem. 

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)

We ran into some problems during this step of the process. When Jóhann was trying to generate an SSH key he kept getting the error "Permission denied (publickey)". The steps to correct the problem on the github website did not work. Eventually we managed to make it work by omitting "ssh-add" when asked for a file to save the key. The rest was pretty straightforward as we had some previous experience using vim.

## 5. Unnið með Git (2. hluti)

We had no problems editing the markdown file. We used the same method as in part 3 of the assignment and then followed the instructions that were linked to in the assignment description.
